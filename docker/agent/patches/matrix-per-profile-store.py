"""Patch hermes-agent so each PROFILE gets its own Matrix crypto store.

THE BUG (upstream, plugins/platforms/matrix/adapter.py)
-------------------------------------------------------
    # Store directory for E2EE keys and sync state.
    # Uses get_hermes_home() so each profile gets its own Matrix store.
    _STORE_DIR = _get_hermes_dir("platforms/matrix/store", "matrix/store")
    _CRYPTO_DB_PATH = _STORE_DIR / "crypto.db"

The comment states the intent; the code does the opposite. `_get_hermes_dir()` reads
HERMES_HOME, and `_profile_runtime_scope()` does rebind HERMES_HOME per profile — but
these are MODULE CONSTANTS, evaluated once at import, long before any profile scope is
entered. Every profile therefore shares whichever home was current at import: the
default profile's.

WHY IT MATTERS HERE
-------------------
A PurePrivacy box runs several agents as `gateway.multiplex_profiles` profiles, each a
separate Matrix account on the box's own homeserver. With a shared crypto.db, agent #2
loads agent #1's olm account, `/keys/query` for its own mxid disagrees with the local
identity keys, and `_connect()` returns False. `_start_one_profile_adapters` counts zero
connected adapters and logs nothing at ERROR — so the agent is created, appears in the
app, has a room, and silently never answers.

THE FIX
-------
Resolve the paths lazily, on each use, instead of once at import. Every call site
(`.mkdir()`, `/ "crypto_store.pickle"`, `str()`, an f-string, and two `%s` log args) is
satisfied by a small proxy.

This runs at image build time and is deliberately fail-loud: if a `HERMES_AGENT_REF`
bump changes these lines, the build FAILS rather than silently shipping unpatched.
Re-check upstream on every bump — if they fix it, delete this patch and the COPY/RUN
pair in docker/agent/Dockerfile.

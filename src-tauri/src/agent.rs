//! Agents — provisioning the optional agent runtime that runs beside the box.
//!
//! An "agent" is a Hermes profile with its own Matrix account on THIS box. The box owns
//! provisioning because it holds the registration token; the agent container owns running
//! the model. The two meet at a handoff file on a shared volume — credentials never ride
//! account-data, which the phone can read.
//!
//! What the phone's one-tap setup triggers, in order:
//!   1. register `@<localpart>:<onion>` against the local client API (token-gated UIA),
//!   2. write the credentials to the handoff volume for the agent container to pick up,
//!   3. create a DM room and invite the agent, so it has somewhere to talk,
//!   4. publish the roster to account-data, which is what makes the phone's Agents app
//!      show it — and, crucially, what keeps it OUT of Messaging.
//!
//! Step 4 is the security-relevant one: the phone decides "human or AI" from this roster
//! and nothing else. A username is a string a remote box can choose, so inferring it from
//! the user id would let a federated peer masquerade as (or hide) an AI.
